/*
    Path Sum II

    Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, 
    return all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals targetSum.

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: []
